## Instructions

First download the zip file and open the index.html in the browser

To play this game the point is to get across the game board without colliding with the enemies (bugs). 

To do this simply use your keyboard arrows to move up, down, left and right. 

If you at any point collide with the enemy you well be restarted back at the starting position.

Once you get across the board to the water portion without any collisions, the game will also restart you to the start.
